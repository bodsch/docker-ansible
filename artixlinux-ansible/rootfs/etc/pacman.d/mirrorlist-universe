#
# Universe is a repository maintained by Artix package maintainers and contains some programs
# which are not provided in the 4 main repositories - mostly programs from the AUR, like web
# browsers (Firefox-ESR, Librewolf, ungoogled-chromium, brave, tor-browser), Thunderbird with birdtray,
# FreeTube, programs for hybrid GPUs (optimus-manager, gamemodeswitch, etc.), Spotifyd, ZFS, Zramen,
# and other useful packages (e.g. nvidia-390xx driver).
# Recently, artix-archlinux-support, which provides systemd and systemd-libs stubs as compatibility
# props, was moved into [universe].
